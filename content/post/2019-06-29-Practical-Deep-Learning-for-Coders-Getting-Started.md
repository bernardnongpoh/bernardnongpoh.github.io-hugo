# Practical Deep Learning for Coders, V3 Lesson 1 by Jeremy Howard


## Cloud Computing for Deep Learning
- Google compute platform 
- Salamander
- Colab - free

## I will be using Colab for this course. No money to pay for cloud

https://course.fast.ai/start_colab.html

In Google Colab we need to save our work locally, meaning that the Google Clab is not responsible for saving our work. 

The first step is to download the course material from fast.ai to do that, go ahead add a link to the github repository as shown in Figure below. 

To change the runtime of the Colab. Go to Runtime and click change runtime type and select CPU/CPU/TPU (Tensor Processing Unit)

## Configure the notebook instance
Install necessary packages as below by creating a code cell, and running:

!curl -s https://course.fast.ai/setup/colab | bash

Saving the data files to Google drive 

We let Google Colab autorize accesses to drive.
